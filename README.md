<h2>How It's Made:</h2>


<p>Tech used: Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Cloudinary, Google Authentication, MVC, EJS, CSS, Bootstrap</p>

<p>During the development of OURSElite, I gained valuable experience in backend development. Working with Express.js, MongoDB, and related technologies provided insights into structuring backend operations, managing data, and ensuring smooth server-client interactions. Integration of Google Authentication enhanced platform security while Cloudinary facilitated image management for an improved user experience. </p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>This project significantly contributed to my understanding of backend development. Learning to work with Express.js and MongoDB deepened my comprehension of backend systems, RESTful API development, and database integration. Implementing Google Authentication for user security and Cloudinary for image management further broadened my skill set in third-party service integration.</p>
